Hey! Thanks For Downloading My Files! If You Plan To Use This In Any Kind Of Youtube Video Or Other Media, Please Credit Me Somewhere In The Video Or Description. I Included The Source Code In Case You Wanted It Too, But All You Need Is The Jar File. Thanks And Have Fun! 

How To Use:
1. Make Sure You Have Java Installed.
2. Run The Jar File And Type In The Location Of Your options.txt file
   It Should Be SomeThing Along The Lines Of C:\\User\\NAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\.minecraft\\options.txt
   **NOTE**
   The Path Must Have Two Backslashes Between Each Folder Like Shown Above Or Else Java Will Not Take The FilePath
3. The New File Will Be Created On Your Desktop 
4. Move The Original options.txt To A Safe Place
5. Move The Newely Created File To Your .minecraft Folder
6. You Are Done!
7. The File Will Only Be Created If There Is No options.txt On The Destop, So If You Want To Make Another One, Delete The File Or Make A New One
8. HAVE FUN!
